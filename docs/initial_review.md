# Initial Assessment  

## Resources  
- [CADOrchestrator GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.com/gitbuilding/cadorchestrator)  
- [Nimble Assembly Documentation](https://wakoma.github.io/nimble/assembly-docs/)  
- [Nimble Generate Documentation](https://github.com/Wakoma/nimble/blob/master/generate.md)  

## Key Issues  

### 1. Failure to Generate Docker Images for Development Environments  

I encountered difficulties in producing Docker images to set up the development environments for each repository due to several underlying assumptions:  

#### a) Scattered Operational and Replication Details  

Key operational details are inconsistently distributed across the repositories. For example, the **CADOrchestrator** repository is not directly operable. Instead, the **cadorchestrator-example** repository must be used for initial Docker image building, as the necessary `.yml` configuration file is missing.  

**Recommendation:** Including an example configuration file within the **CADOrchestrator** source repository would facilitate sandboxed testing.  

#### b) Inconsistencies Between Examples and Nimble-CADOrchestration Operations  

The **CADOrchestrator** repository explicitly includes a `.yml` configuration file, whereas **Nimble-CADOrchestration** relies on a hardcoded configuration script that generates this file.  

**Action Taken:** A note has been added to highlight the need for future modifications to align these approaches.  

#### c) Hardcoded Server Ports  

The server defaults to port **8000**, with no configuration option to modify it. The `--production` flag determines the serverâ€™s binding:  
- `0.0.0.0` (for external access)  
- `127.0.0.1` (for local access)  

**Recommendation:** For best development practices, this option should be configurable to support encapsulated environments such as containers or virtual machines. This is particularly important when using **Xorg** or a framebuffer for graphical operations, as it would enhance debugging capabilities.  

#### d) Silent Bugs and Errors  

Issues related to **OpenCASCADE, VRT,** or other OpenSCAD backend components are difficult to diagnose when the server is running.  

**Recommendation:** Implement better `stdout` error handling to facilitate debugging, detect broken dependencies, and improve maintainability in containerized environments.  

#### e) Dependency Management Challenges  

A **CADOrchestrator** instance is embedded within the **Nimble** repository, creating redundancy and complicating maintenance. This duplication makes the system more error-prone, as **CADOrchestrator** is also specified separately.  

**Recommendation:** Streamline dependency management to avoid unnecessary redundancy.

### 3. Running with XVFB  

**Command:**
xvfb-run -a --server-args="-screen 0 1024x768x24" cadorchestrator serve --production

xvfb-run -a --server-args="-screen 0 1024x768x24" cadorchestrator --headless generate
